> WARNING: Some users had reported that debugger completely halts sandbox. Currently, this issue is not fixed and no known steps to reproduce. If you have some info about it please share. So please, before debugger usage make sure that you have availability to restart sandbox for the case if extension halts yours.



## Getting Started
To use this extension, you must first open the folder containing the cartridges you want to work on or one of subfolders contain folder `cartridges`.

## Using the debugger

When your launch config is set up, you can debug your project! Pick a launch config from the dropdown on the Debug pane in Code. Press the play button or F5 to start.


### Configuration

The extension operates in one mode - it launch an adapter that connects to sandbox. Just like when using the other debugger, you configure with a `.vscode/launch.json` file in the root directory of your project. You can create this file manually, or Code will create one for you if you try to run your project, and it doesn't exist yet.

### Launch
Example `launch.json` configs with `"request": "launch"`. You must specify hostname and other credentials. `cartridgeroot` could be set to `auto` so extention will try do detect path, othervise please set absolute path to folder that contains cartridges. Note: `workspaceroot` should be set to `${workspaceRoot}` unless you know what you doing.

```json
{
    "version": "0.1.0",
    "configurations": [
      {
          "type": "prophet",
          "request": "launch",
          "name": "Attach to Sandbox",
          "hostname": "*.demandware.net",
          "username": "<username>",
          "password": "<password>",
          "codeversion": "version1",
          "cartridgeroot": "auto",
          "workspaceroot": "${workspaceRoot}"
      }
    ]
}
```

> Note: for windows user `cartridgeroot` should be set as absolute path to cartridges folder, i.e. `C:\\some\\folder\\path\\to\\cartridges`

If you want to use a different sandboxes, you can also setup several configurations.


### Other optional launch config fields
* `trace`: When true, the adapter logs its own diagnostic info to console. This is often useful info to include when filing an issue on GitHub. 


## Using the uploader

Configuration for uploader should live in the file named `dw.json` (similar is used by `dwupload` and is compatible witn the uploader). Configuration should be placed in the directory that contains all cartridges.

```
├── bc_library
├── bm_integrationframework
├── dw.json
├── jsconfig.json
└── modules
```

Example of file:
```json
{
    "hostname": "example.demandware.net",
    "username": "user",
    "password": "password",
    "cartridge": ["cartridgeA", "cartridgeB"],// optional
    "code-version": "version2"
}
```
The second step: enabling the uploader in workspace preferences. Open preferences, switch to workspace preferences and set value to `true` for `"extension.prophet.upload.enabled"`. Detailed log information is written in output channel `Prophet Uploader`. (Note: once you change `dw.json` you should run 'Clean Project/Upload all' from command menu to apply it).

You can temporarily disable watching or force upload cartridges (i.e. clean project) via commands.

* Prophet: Enable Upload
* Prophet: Disable Upload
* Prophet: Clean Project/Upload all

(press F1 and select command)

#### Other configuration

* `extension.prophet.cartridges.path` - List of cartridges separated by colon. Allows  quick open don't ask a user to choose the file. Automatically open file that match first cartridge in list.
* `extension.prophet.ismlServer.activateOn` - allow activate isml server for non standatd (isml) files, ex. `html`


### Improve experience

Experience can be improved by using follow `jsconfig.json` in the folder with cartridges. It allows resolve absolute paths in scripts correctly, (except it starts with `~`).

```json
{
    "compilerOptions": {
        "target": "es5",
        "baseUrl": "./",
        "paths": {
            "*" : ["./*", "modules/*"]
        }
    },
    "typeAcquisition": {
        "enable": true
    }
}
```
